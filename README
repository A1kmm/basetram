BaSeTraM (Bayesian Search for Transcription Factor Motifs) is a motif
occurrence finding algorithm designed to search the entire genome for all
occurrences of a particular motif, using as input a matrix of the form:

  A_ij = the empirical frequency (as a raw count) at which base i was present
         at position j from the start of the motif.

It takes into account both uncertainty in the actual true base occurrence
frequencies in the motif, and uncertainty as to whether there is a motif
occurrence at a particular point in the genome, through the use of a Bayesian
framework.

Based on the above assumptions we have developed a principled approach to the
finding of potential motif occurrences.

Installation:
-------------
You will need:
  cmake - http:/www.cmake.org
  parsegenbank - http://code.google.com/p/parsegenbank/
    => You must extract parsegenbank and basetram so they share a common parent
       directory. e.g.
     src
       parsegenbank
       basetram
  boost - http://www.boost.org/
  A standards compliant C++ compiler; we used GNU GCC v4.3.x

Once you have installed all the dependencies, do:
  cmake -LA .
  make

You can now run basetram in place.
